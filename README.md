# hacker_cup
My solutions to some of the hacker cups

They are done using Go 1.5.3

If you wish to run them
First install go

Then run
```
source .hacker_cup
```

This adds 2 aliases

```hrun``` which runs against input.txt and outputs to output.txt
```htest`` which runs against example.txt and outputs to terminal only
